# ML Crash Course from Google

https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course

These are notes more for my own reminders and active learning, not a summary of the entire course. To do your own active learning, I encourage you to write your own summary notes of what's new to you.

- learning from _**EXAMPLES**_ (inputs/features) to _**predict**_ (outputs/inferences) like a _**scientist**_ (observations & stats)

- reminder-to-self:
  - regression = continuous value predictions (e.g. price, probability)
  - classification = discrete options predictions (e.g. yes/no, cat/dog/fish)
